    RECOMMENATION - If you are able to specify which pixels should be treated as background for
    your observations, consider using NSClean, the enhanced second-generation
    NIRSpec cleaner. It does a much better job of removing correlated read noise

    NSClean1 is a first generation NIRSpec cleaner. It uses default areas of background
    pixels to fit and subtract a highly smoothed background model. Compared to the
    NIRSpec Team's "rolling median" technique, it marginally more uniform and more
    tunable.
